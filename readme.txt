An add-on for the Hype Theme to add music, video, and tour functionality.

== Description ==

The StartBox Hype child theme was built with bands in mind, but we realized that some of the core features would work just as well for individuals who just want to display their social networking content in one easy place.  Rather than including all of the features that we thought pertained to bands, we moved them to an add-on built specifically for Hype.  With this add-on, you will gain access to a Tour Dates custom post type so you can add and manage your tours; the ability to display YouTube or Vimeo videos; the ability to embed a SoundCloud playlist; and the ability to display your BigCartel products.

--------------------------

== Installation ==

1. Upload the 'hype-band-addon' directory to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Visit the theme options page ('/wp-admin/themes.php?page=sb_admin') and set your SoundCloud Playlist URL, YouTube/Vimeo Video URL, and your BigCartel store name.
